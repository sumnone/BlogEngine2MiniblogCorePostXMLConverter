# BlogEngine2MiniblogCorePostXMLConverter
Converts BlogEngine.Net (dotnetblogengine.net) posts to Miniblog.Core (github.com/madskristensen/Miniblog.Core) posts.

BlogEngine.net and Miniblog.Core have a similar XML format for content. This program simply converts the older BlogEngine.net format to newer Miniblog.Core format.

There is a new version of BlogEngine.net at BlogEngine.io, but is not the original auther. This program should work for either version, although I didn't test with the newer version.

Both blogging platforms put posts in a folder called "posts." Simply copy the "posts" folder to your Windows desktop and run the converter. It will convert the output to the "posts/output" folder. It's easy enough to change the path if you want.
